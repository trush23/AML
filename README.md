Research at AML-Courant Institute as a postdoc
The project involved studying swimming of C. elegans in fluidic environment in the presence of obstacles. I created controlled obstacle-laden environments using micro-fab and created arrays of micro-pillars of varying spacings. The main result was that in fact obstacles improve the swimming efficiency of the worms.
